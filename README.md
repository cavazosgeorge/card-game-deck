## Shuffle Deck

#### This simple card game will have the following features

<br />

- newDeck

  - Create a list of playing cards (52). Essentially an array of strings

- Print

  - Log out the contents of a deck of cards

- Shuffle

  - Shuffles all the cards in a deck

- Deal

  - Create a 'hand' of cards

- saveToFile
  - Save a list of cards to a file on the local machine
- newDeckFromFile
  - Load a list of cards from the local machine

#### This is my first attempt at creating a multi-featured program in **Go**.
